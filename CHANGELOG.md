## [Unreleased] - 2025-05-30

### ðŸŽ¯ Today's Roadmap
- **Documentation Sync**: Update changelog to reflect actual version 0.1.20
- **Deployment Verification**: Confirm all fixes from v0.1.6-0.1.17 are working in production
- **Outstanding Issues Investigation**:
  - VersionInfo component visibility on live site
  - Location detection state conversion (TX â†’ Texas)
  - Cities dropdown returning 0 results for Rockwall County
- **Feature Enhancement Planning**: Next phase development priorities

### ðŸš€ **ILLINOIS STATE EXPANSION RESEARCH** âœ… COMPLETED

**Research Question:** Does Illinois provide EDI-style tax data like Texas?
**Answer:** YES! Illinois provides superior data sources to Texas.

**Illinois Data Sources Available:**
- âœ… **Machine-Readable Files**: County/Municipality + Address-specific files for developers
- âœ… **MyTax Illinois Tax Rate Finder**: Interactive API-accessible lookup tool  
- âœ… **Tax Matrix Downloads**: CSV/PDF formats with comprehensive rate breakdowns
- âœ… **Dual Rate System**: 6.25% general, 1% food/medicine (restaurant-specific benefit)
- âœ… **Quarterly Updates**: January 1 and July 1 (more frequent than Texas)
- âœ… **102 Counties Coverage**: Complete Illinois state coverage

**Implementation Complexity:** MEDIUM
- More sophisticated than Texas (dual rates, origin/destination sourcing)
- Better data availability and API access
- Restaurant-focused benefits (food rate differentiation)

**Next Steps for Illinois Integration:**
1. Update state selection dropdown to include Illinois
2. Create Illinois data importer service (similar to TaxDataImporter.ts)
3. Add dual-rate support to database schema
4. Implement destination/origin sourcing logic
5. Update frontend UI to show rate breakdowns for restaurants
